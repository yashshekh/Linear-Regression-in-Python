# Introduction

This project explores Linear Regression, a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used for predictive modeling. The notebook demonstrates various methods of implementing linear regression in Python, including hands-on coding examples and visualizations.

# Data Analysis

The dataset used in this project is the house sales data from King County. The data is analyzed to understand the relationships between the features and the target variable (house price).

# Simple Linear Regression

This section demonstrates the implementation of simple linear regression with one feature:

-   **Gradient Descent Implementation**: A step-by-step Python implementation of gradient descent to minimize the cost function.
-   **Scipy Implementation**: Utilizing `Scipy` for linear regression.
-   **Scikit-Learn Implementation**: A quick and efficient implementation using the popular `Scikit-Learn` library.
-   **Statsmodel Implementation**: Implementing linear regression using the `Statsmodel` library, providing detailed statistical summaries.
-   **Gradient Descent Visualization**: Visualizing the multi-step process of gradient descent.
-   **Gradient Descent Animation**: An animated view of how gradient descent converges to the optimal solution.

# Multiple Linear Regression

This section covers multiple linear regression with more than one feature:

-   **Gradient Descent Implementation**: Implementing gradient descent for multiple linear regression.
-   **Scikit-Learn Implementation**: Using `Scikit-Learn` for efficient multiple linear regression.
-   **Normal Equation Method**: Solving the regression equation using the normal equation method.
